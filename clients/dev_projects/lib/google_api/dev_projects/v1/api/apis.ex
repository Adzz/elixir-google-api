  Get the ApiData definition details for a given API.

  ## Parameters

  - connection (GoogleApi.DevProjects.V1.Connection): Connection to server
  - apis_id (String): The resource ID.
  - opts (KeywordList): [optional] Optional parameters
    - :alt (String): Data format for the response.
    - :fields (String): Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
    - :key (String): API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
    - :oauth_token (String): OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
    - :pretty_print (Boolean): Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
    - :quota_user (String): Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. Overrides userIp if both are provided.
    - :user_ip (String): IP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to enforce per-user limits.
    - :locale (String): The language code, country code and locale variant encoded as a single string. This is intended to be the locale for the end user, and hence the target of translations. Presence of the language code indicates that the response should include translation strings for the requested sections, as appropriate.
    - :project_id (String): The numeric ID of the project for which to get the API definition. It has to be either the ID of the project producing the API or the ID of a project having the API available for consumption
    - :whitelist_id (String): The whitelist project ID. See Projects.Insert.whitelist_id documentation for details.
