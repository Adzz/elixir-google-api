  Removes an API available for consumption from the consumer project. This can be invoked by either the API producer or the API consumer.

  ## Parameters

  - connection (GoogleApi.DevProjects.V1.Connection): Connection to server
  - opts (KeywordList): [optional] Optional parameters
    - :alt (String): Data format for the response.
    - :fields (String): Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
    - :key (String): API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
    - :oauth_token (String): OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
    - :pretty_print (Boolean): Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
    - :quota_user (String): Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. Overrides userIp if both are provided.
    - :user_ip (String): IP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to enforce per-user limits.
    - :api_id_token (String): The ID of the API for which to delete the API consumption details
    - :consumer_project_id (String): The consumer project ID for which to delete the API consumption details
    - :producer_project_id (String): The producer project ID for which to delete the API consumption details
    - :whitelist_id (String): The whitelist project ID. See Projects.Insert.whitelist_id documentation for details.

  @doc """
  Updates the configuration of consumption of an API. The update can change producer-specific configuration like the API consumption status or quota constraints. By switching the consumption status the producer can pause/resume the consumption of the API. Through quota constraints the producer can set or clear an explicit per-consumer daily quota, overriding the per-API default.
