  Lists all deployments for a given project.

  ## Parameters

  - connection (GoogleApi.DeploymentManager.V2.Connection): Connection to server
  - project (String): The project ID for this request.
  - opts (KeywordList): [optional] Optional parameters
    - :alt (String): Data format for the response.
    - :fields (String): Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
    - :key (String): API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
    - :oauth_token (String): OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
    - :pretty_print (Boolean): Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
    - :quota_user (String): Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. Overrides userIp if both are provided.
    - :user_ip (String): IP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to enforce per-user limits.
    - :filter (String): Sets a filter {expression} for filtering listed resources. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use name ne example-instance.  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
    - :max_results (Integer): The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable values are 0 to 500, inclusive. (Default: 500)
    - :order_by (String): Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy&#x3D;\&quot;creationTimestamp desc\&quot;. This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
    - :page_token (String): Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.

  - opts (KeywordList): [optional] Optional parameters
    - :alt (String): Data format for the response.
    - :fields (String): Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
    - :key (String): API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
    - :oauth_token (String): OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
    - :pretty_print (Boolean): Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
    - :quota_user (String): Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. Overrides userIp if both are provided.
    - :user_ip (String): IP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to enforce per-user limits.
    - :create_policy (String): Sets the policy to use for creating new resources.
    - :delete_policy (String): Sets the policy to use for deleting resources.
    - :preview (Boolean): If set to true, updates the deployment and creates and updates the \&quot;shell\&quot; resources but does not actually alter or instantiate these resources. This allows you to preview what your deployment will look like. You can use this intent to preview how an update would affect your deployment. You must provide a target.config with a configuration if this is set to true. After previewing a deployment, you can deploy your resources by making a request with the update() or you can cancelPreview() to remove the preview altogether. Note that the deployment will still exist after you cancel the preview and you must separately delete this deployment if you want to remove it.
