  Returns a list showing the current progress on events in this application for the currently authenticated user.

  ## Parameters

  - connection (GoogleApi.Games.V1.Connection): Connection to server
  - opts (KeywordList): [optional] Optional parameters
    - :alt (String): Data format for the response.
    - :fields (String): Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
    - :key (String): API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
    - :oauth_token (String): OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
    - :pretty_print (Boolean): Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
    - :quota_user (String): Available to use for quota purposes for server-side applications. Can be any arbitrary string assigned to a user, but should not exceed 40 characters. Overrides userIp if both are provided.
    - :user_ip (String): IP address of the site where the request originates. Use this if you want to enforce per-user limits.
    - :consistency_token (String): The last-seen mutation timestamp.
    - :language (String): The preferred language to use for strings returned by this method.
    - :max_results (Integer): The maximum number of events to return in the response, used for paging. For any response, the actual number of events to return may be less than the specified maxResults.
    - :page_token (String): The token returned by the previous request.
